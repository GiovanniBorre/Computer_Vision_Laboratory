# Homographies

The Homography transformation is a popular geo-referencing technique used worldwide. It is based on quite complex geometric and mathematic concepts, known as *homogeneous coordinate* and *projective planes*, the explanation of which is not within the scope of this document.
Just to give a simplified idea, the familiar Cartesian plane is composed by a set of points which have a one-to-one correlation to pairs of real numbers. The *projective planes* instead is a superset of that real plane where for each point we also consider all possible (infinite) straight lines towards space.
In this scenario every 2D point can be projected in any other plane in the space. Based on these concepts, it is defined the **homography between 2 planes** which, simply speaking, means that given 4 points in a plane, there always exists a relationship that transforms them into the corresponding 4 points in another plane.
Initially the homography has not been used for map geo-referencing but for other purposes, such as to rectify a perspective image, for example to generate a *plan* view of a building from a *perspective* photo.
