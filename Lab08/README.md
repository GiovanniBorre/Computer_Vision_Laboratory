# Fundamental matrix estimation

The essential property of the essential matrix is that it conveniently encapsulates the epipolargeometry of the imaging configuration. More specifically, ifxandx′are homogeneousnormalized image coordinates in image 1 and 2, respectively, then

(x')^\top F x = 0

if x and x′correspond to the same 3D point in the scene.
